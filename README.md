## Approximate Projections

This repository contains the implementation of the benchmarking of different projective methods for quantum process and detector tomography conducted in the preprint “[arXiv:2406.11646](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11646)”.

Our evaluation demonstrates the performance of these protocols on quantum channels with up to four qubits for quantum process tomography and systems with up to six qubits for quantum detector tomography. The results highlight superior precision and efficiency compared to existing methods.
